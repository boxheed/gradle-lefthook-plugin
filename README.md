# Gradle Lefthook Plugin

The Gradle Lefthook Plugin is a tool that integrates Lefthook, a powerful Git hooks manager, into your Gradle projects. This plugin simplifies the process of managing Git hooks by allowing you to configure and run Lefthook directly from your Gradle build scripts.

## Features

- Seamless integration of Lefthook with Gradle projects.
- Easy configuration of Git hooks using Gradle tasks.
- Supports all Lefthook features, including parallel execution and custom scripts.
- Automatically installs Lefthook if not already present.

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- Gradle 5.0 or higher
- Lefthook installed on your system (optional, as the plugin can install it for you)

## Installation

To apply the Gradle Lefthook Plugin to your project, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.example.lefthook' version '0.1.0'
}
```

## Usage

Once the plugin is applied, you can configure Lefthook in your build.gradle file:

```groovy
lefthook {
  options {
    autoinstall = false // sets autoinstall - defaut is true
    version = "v1.11.12" //sets the version of lefthook - defaults to "latest"
  }
  config { // lefthook file as groovy maps. This will be converted to yaml and applied to the .efthho.yml file
    [
      "assert_lefthook_installed": true,
      "pre-commit": [
        "follow": true,
        "commands": [
          "test": [
            "glob": "*.{groovy,java}",
            "run": "./gradlew test"
          ]
        ]
      ],
      "commit-msg": [
        "follow": true,
        "scripts": [
          {install "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaobsjunior/sh-conventional-commits/16dbdae09db941718750db62d4fdbd737da7784e/commit-msg"}: [

          ]
        ]
      ]
